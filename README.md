# Hill Valley Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a data point corresponds to a hill or a valley using a logistic regression model. It provides insights into the data and demonstrates predictive modeling techniques in Python.

## Objective
The primary goal is to build a machine learning model to classify the data into two categories: `Hill` or `Valley`.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [YBI Foundation GitHub Repository](https://github.com/YBIFoundation/Dataset/raw/main/Hill%20Valley%20Dataset.csv).

### Features
- The dataset contains features that represent patterns in data related to hills and valleys.

### Target Variable
- The target variable indicates whether a point belongs to a hill or a valley.

## Tools and Libraries
The following tools and Python libraries are used in this project:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating the logistic regression model.

## Steps Included
1. **Data Import**: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, scale features, and split the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Building**: Train a logistic regression model using the training data.
4. **Evaluation**: Assess the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Visualization**: Present key findings through plots and charts.

## Getting Started
To replicate this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Hill_Valley_Prediction.ipynb
    ```

## Results
- The logistic regression model successfully classifies data points into hill or valley categories.
- Detailed metrics and visualizations are provided in the notebook.
